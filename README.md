# Tennis Database

This full-stack web application is a searchable database of full-length professional tennis match videos. Users can easily search and filter matches by player names, tournaments, and year to quickly find relevant content.

The frontend is built with **React** and **Bootstrap**, using **Vite** for fast development and bundling. Filter state and search input are managed using Reactâ€™s ```useState``` hook, allowing for a smooth and responsive user experience.

The backend is powered by **Express.js** and **MongoDB**, handling API requests and storing match metadata. The app is deployed via **fly.io** for fast and reliable hosting.

The codebase is structured as a monorepo, with clearly separated ```client``` and ```server``` directories for frontend and backend logic.
